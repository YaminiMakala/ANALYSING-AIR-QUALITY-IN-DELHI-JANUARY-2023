ANALYSING AIR QUALITY IN DELHI: JANUARY 2023

## Overview
Air quality index (AQI) analysis is a crucial aspect of environmental data science that involves monitoring and analyzing air quality in a specific location. It aims to provide a numerical value representative of overall air quality, essential for public health and environmental management.

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the air quality in Delhi for the month of January 2023. By gathering air quality data from various sources and following standardized methodologies, we aim to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) and provide insights into the overall air quality status in the region.

## Steps for Air Quality Index Analysis
Below are the steps we can follow for the task of Air Quality Index Analysis:

1. **Gather air quality data**: Collect data from various sources, such as government monitoring stations, sensors, or satellite imagery, to obtain comprehensive air quality measurements for Delhi.

2. **Clean and preprocess data**: Process the collected data to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis.

3. **Calculate the Air Quality Index**: Utilize standardized formulas and guidelines provided by environmental agencies to calculate the AQI based on the collected air quality data. This involves converting pollutant concentrations into a single numerical value representing overall air quality.

4. **Create visualizations**: Generate visual representations, such as line charts or heatmaps, to illustrate the AQI trends over time or across different geographical regions within Delhi. Visualizations help in understanding and communicating the air quality data effectively.

5. **Compare with recommended metrics**: Compare the calculated AQI metrics of Delhi with the recommended air quality standards and guidelines provided by regulatory authorities. This comparison helps in assessing the level of air pollution and its potential impacts on public health and the environment.
